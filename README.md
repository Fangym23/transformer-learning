# Historical Data Generation
The historical data is generated using Ridge Regression trained on synthetic bandit interactions.We create n_bandits 
(e.g., 20), each representing a different past experience. Each bandit has its own ground truth weight vector w_true, 
which is generated by normal distribution.The trained coefficients from Ridge Regression are stored as historical_data.

# result of the experiment
The result of the experiment,this is the graph of cumulative regret is stored in the folder called "new_figure". 

# other settngs
The setting of contextual bandit and network is the same as the original experiment. I copy the code from the 
file NeuralUCB.ipynb.
